The unofficial SoundCloud desktop app for Windows
</p>

# Features
- Dark theme
- Bypass the blocking of most tracks

# App Protocol
> You can use the `sc://` protocol to follow a url within an application

> You need to replace `https://soundcloud.com/...` to `sc://...` like `https://soundcloud.com/discover` => `sc://discover`


# Configs
> You can use your own proxy when connecting to SoundCloud

> Recommended location: Switzerland

Modify the `config.js` file.

`proxy` - an array with links to connect to a proxy (like `1.1.1.1:80` or `user:password@ip:port`)

> Security Recommendation: Better use `user:password` access or only allow connections to the following servers: `.soundcloud.com .sndcdn.com soundcloud-upload.s3.amazonaws.com`

**! Warning**
Proxy will not help, in case of blocking by ISP/gov. As an example: Russian Computer Oversight (RKN) decrypts http(s) connections and checks for blacklisted domains. To bypass such blocking, recommended to use a VPN on your personal hosting.
